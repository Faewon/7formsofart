            <p>With sculpture, visual art is no longer limited to the dimensional surface of a painting, drawing, or photograph, as it consists of all three-dimensional artworks. A sculpture is most often produced using materials such as marble, wood, copper, or bronze.</p>
            <p>Even today, these materials are most frequently used. However, with the arrival of new technologies, think of 3D printing, plexiglass, fiberglass, steel, epoxy, or electronic devices, sculpture takes on various materials used by contemporary sculptors. Not only did the technological developments affect the materials used, but so did the development of art history. One of the critical moments in recent art history is, without any doubt, Marcel Duchamp’s fountain, which introduced the ready-made into the three-dimensional world of sculpture. Ever since, daily objects, which can be pretty much everything, can be implemented in sculpture. Further, with the arrival of Installation Art, three-dimensional artworks are no longer fixed objects but can also be decors or assemblages of objects in a room.</p>
