              <p>With painting, the artist works on a two-dimensional surface. This surface is mostly a stretched linen, cotton canvas, or wooden panel. Some artists also paint on other surfaces, such as metal or plastic. Think of copper or linoleum, to name a few.</p>
              <p>The substance or medium the artist uses is, of course, paint, mostly acrylic, tempera, or oil paint. In order to paint, there is also a medium to manipulate the paint. With tempera, the artist uses egg and water. This technique was prevalent in Italy before oil painting, and its possibilities were introduced by Northern artists. With acrylic paint, the artist only needs water. With oil paint, the artist uses a painting medium of oil, such as linseed oil, walnut oil, or turpentine. Oil painting was invented – or rather perfectionized – by the aforementioned Jan Van Eyck in the 14th century, resulting in a breakthrough in painting, enabling artists to achieve a very high sense of naturalism due to this technique.</p>
